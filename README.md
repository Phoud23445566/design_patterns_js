# JavaScript Design Patterns Demo

This repository contains example implementations of 5 commonly used design patterns in JavaScript. Each pattern includes simple code, inline comments, and can be executed independently.

## 📦 Patterns Included

1. **Singleton Pattern**  
   Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

2. **Observer Pattern**  
   Allows an object (subject) to notify other objects (observers) about changes in state.

3. **Factory Pattern**  
   Creates objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

4. **Strategy Pattern**  
   Enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime.

5. **Module Pattern**  
   Encapsulates related functionalities and exposes only the intended interface.
